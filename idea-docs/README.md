## What Is This?

**Lazy Genius 2.0** is a radically simple knowledge management system for Claude Code that:
- 📝 **Automatically tracks** every coding decision and pattern
- 🧠 **Remembers everything** across sessions (Claude never forgets!)
- 👥 **Shares knowledge** with your entire team via Git
- 🚫 **Learns from mistakes** and prevents repeated errors
- ⚡ **Adds <1ms overhead** to your workflow

All with **ZERO dependencies** - just Git (which you already have).

## 🎯 Why You Need This

### Without Lazy Genius
```
Monday: Spend 3 hours debugging auth
Tuesday: Bob spends 3 hours on same auth bug
Wednesday: Alice hits the same issue...
Thursday: You forget Monday's solution
Friday: 😭
```

### With Lazy Genius
```
Monday: You solve auth bug (auto-tracked)
Tuesday: Bob starts auth, Claude says "I see auth was solved yesterday, using that pattern"
Wednesday: Alice's Claude already knows the solution
Thursday: Your Claude remembers everything
Friday: 🚀
```

## 🚀 Quick Start (Literally 2 Minutes)

### For Individual Developers

```bash
# 1. Clone and run setup (60 seconds)
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/lazy-genius/main/setup.sh
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# 2. That's it! Start using Claude
claude

# Your work is now automatically tracked and remembered!
```

### For Teams

**Team Lead** (one time):
```bash
# Initialize for team
./setup.sh
git add .claude-team
git commit -m "Initialize Lazy Genius"
git push
```

**Team Members**:
```bash
# Join the hive mind
git pull
cp .claude-team/templates/hooks.json .claude/hooks.json
# Done! You now share collective intelligence
```

## 🧠 How It Works

```

### The Magic Files

```
YourProject/
├── .claude/                 # Your private workspace
│   └── hooks.json          # The magic (3 simple hooks)
├── .claude-team/           # Shared team knowledge
│   ├── daily/             # What everyone did today
│   ├── SOLUTIONS.md       # What works
│   ├── ANTIPATTERNS.md    # What doesn't work
│   └── patterns/          # Discovered patterns
└── CLAUDE.md              # Instructions for Claude
```

## 💡 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Automatic Pattern Detection
```bash
# After editing the same file 5+ times
Claude: "I notice you've edited auth.js 8 times today. This appears to be a complex area. Let me document the pattern you're establishing..."
# Automatically added to patterns/auth.md
```

### Example 2: Cross-Developer Learning
```bash
# Developer A on Monday
Claude: "Implementing user search..."
# Struggles for 2 hours, finds solution

# Developer B on Tuesday  
Claude: "I see Developer A implemented user search yesterday with a debounced query pattern. I'll use the same approach."
# Completes in 10 minutes
```

### Example 3: Mistake Prevention
```bash
You: "Let's create a custom API wrapper"
Claude: "According to .claude-team/ANTIPATTERNS.md, custom API wrappers caused issues on 2024-01-15. The team uses generated types instead. Should I use the established pattern?"
```
