## 🚀 Install (One Command)

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aatish-Dhami/claude-lazy-genius/main/install.sh | bash
```

That's it. You're done. Claude now has perfect memory.

## 🎯 What It Does

- 📝 **Tracks** every file you edit automatically
- 🧠 **Remembers** all patterns, solutions, and decisions
- 🚫 **Prevents** repeated mistakes by learning from failures
- 👥 **Shares** knowledge with your entire team via Git
- ⚡ **Zero** configuration, maintenance, or overhead

## 📸 See It In Action

```bash
# Morning: Start coding
$ claude
Claude: "I see yesterday you solved the auth bug. I'll use that pattern."

# Claude automatically knows:
- What you worked on before
- What solutions worked
- What mistakes to avoid
- What your team discovered

# Evening: Share knowledge
$ git push
# Your entire team now benefits from your discoveries
```

## 🤔 How It Works

```
You code → Hooks track → Git stores → Claude remembers → Team benefits
```

No servers. No databases. No complexity. Just text files and Git.

### Prevents Repeated Mistakes

```

### Remembers Everything
```
You: "How did we fix that webpack issue?"
Claude: "On 2024-01-20, you fixed the webpack issue by updating the babel loader config. The solution is documented in .claude-team/SOLUTIONS.md line 47."
